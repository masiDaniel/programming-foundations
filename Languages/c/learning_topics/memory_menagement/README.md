it is the process of handling how much memory a program uses through differet operations 


when you create a program that occupies too much or unnecessary memory, it can result in slow and poor performance 

allocation -  is the process off llocating memory 
static memory - memory reserverd for the progrms before the progrm runs (also known as compile time memory allocation)

dynamic memory - memory that is allocated after the program runs 
dyamc memory does not belong to  vriable hence can only be ccessed with pointers
